                    The data digestion provides easy access to information in a fast and efficient fashion; it is orders of 
                    magnitude faster than current manual approaches.
                    <br><br>
                    The digitization process makes it possible obtain new knowledge and in-sights that is very difficult 
                    or even impossible to achieve using unstructured data in its existing format.
                    <br><br>
                    The knowledge extraction is done through many types of higher order analysis. Examples are:

                        Drilling history: A knowledge graph is used to visualize dependencies between wells and 
                        understand the drilling history in an area. The analysis is constructed by interrogating each well in the 
                        database and investigating the degree of correlation with the remaining wells

                        Rock physics modelling: As all tables in well reports are available as .csv files the parameter 
                        selection building a rock physics model can be done with higher confidence. Clay volume cut-offs, 
                        end member definitions and depth trends are more easily picked and validated. It allows for a 
                        geological constrained rock physics models that are supported by huge amount of data, as opposed 
                        to a limited block-by-block approach, where data is sparse

                        Sedimentology: Using t-Distribute Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), which are dimension 
                        reduction techniques suited for visualizing high-dimensional data, thin sections from several hundred 
                        well reports can be clustered without any prior knowledge with similar features regardless of their 
                        geospatial proximity. As any identified images are tagged the origin is fully traceable back to the 
                        specific page in the original report
